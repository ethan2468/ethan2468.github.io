<h4> Mario</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="h1">-The first game&nbsp; in the franchise was Donkey Kong, released as an arcade on July 9th, 1981. It features Mario (then known as Jumpman)&nbsp;battling obstacles in order to save his girlfriend from a giant ape named Donkey Kong. </p>
<p class="h1">-The second major game to be released was Mario Bros., released as an arcade on July 14th, 1983, and was the first to feature Luigi. The game involves Mario and Luigi fighting enemies that are coming out through pipes.</p>
<p class="h1">-The first Mario game to be released on a home console was Wrecking Crew on June 18th, 1985. Later that year on September 13th, the more popular Super Mario Bros. was released. This was the first game in the Super Mario Bros. series and involves Mario or Luigi running across eight worlds, each containing four levels, battling enemies along the way with the ultimate goal being to rescue Princess Peach (then known as Princess Toadstool) from King Koopa (Bowser). </p>
<p class="h1">-The second Super Mario Bros. games was Super Mario Bros. 2, which was about Mario, Luigi, Toad and Princess Peach adventuring across a dream world to defeat the evil frog king Wart. The game allows you to select one of the four characters, giving you the option at the beginning of each level. </p>
<p class="h1">-The third game was Super Mario Bros. 3, released in 1988 in Japan and 1990 in North America. This game involves Mario traveling across eight worlds and at the end the first seven, defeating Bowser’s minions (known as the Koopalings). This was the first Mario game to feature world maps. </p>
<p class="h1">-Super Mario World was released in 1990 on the SNES. In this game, Mario is in Dinosaur Land which has been attacked by Bowser and the Koopalings. Like Super Mario Bros. 3 before it, the game contains a world map with each world having a boss level at the end. In the game, you are able to ride a dinosaur named Yoshi. This, therefore, makes the game the first to feature Yoshi. </p>
<p class="h1">-Throughout the 1990s, several spin-offs of the Super Mario Bros. series were made for the SNES, Game Boy, Nintendo 64, and other platforms; some good and some bad. Examples of these games include Dr. Mario, Super Mario Kart, Mario Party, Super Smash Bros., Yoshi’s Story, and the infamous Hotel Mario. </p>
<p class="h1"> -In 1996, a truly revolutionary Mario game, Super Mario 64, was released for the Nintendo 64. This was the first Mario game made entirely with 3D graphics. The game is about the 120 stars of Princess Peach’s castle having been trapped in several different rooms by Bowser, each room being its own individual level. Earlier that year, Super Mario RPG was released for the SNES containing partial 3D graphics. </p>
<p class="h1">-Just as in the 1990s, throughout the 2000s, several spin-off games were released, often part of the same series, such as Mario Kart, Mario Party, Super Smash Bros., Luigi’s Mansion, several Donkey Kong and Yoshi games, as well as Mario sports games, such as Mario Tennis and Mario Golf. </p>
<p class="h1">-The late 2000s saw the revival of the classic Super Mario Bros. games, starting with New Super Mario Bros., released on the Nintendo DS in 2006. Three years later in 2009, the Wii version of the game was released, and in 2012, the Wii U version. Both the Wii and Wii U versions are able to have up to four players at one time. A direct sequel to the original New Super Mario Bros. for the DS was released in 2012, this time for the more recent 3DS. All of these games feature a side-scrolling screen as well as eight worlds just like the three original Super Mario Bros. games from the 1980s.</p>
<p class="h1">-Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 were both released for the Wii in 2007 and 2010 respectively. The two games feature Mario going on adventures in space. Super Mario 3D Land was released in 2011 for the 3DS and Super Mario 3D World in 2013 for the Wii U. Super Mario 3D Land along with New Super Mario Bros. 2 saw the revival from the Tanooki suit featured in Super Mario Bros. 3. In Super Mario 3D World, a cat suit power-up became available so Mario could mimic the behaviour of a cat. </p>
<p class="h1">-Super Mario Maker, released in 2015 for the Wii U, is a game where one can design their own Mario levels using styles from different Mario games. The same is true for its sequel, Super Mario Maker 2, released in 2019 for the Nintendo Switch. It contains styles and features from more modern Mario games such as Super Mario 3D World. </p>
<p class="h1">-Super Mario Odyssey is the flagship game for the Nintendo Switch, and was released in 2017. The game is single-player and features Mario going on an adventure to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser who is going to forcefully be married to him. Mario runs through several different detailed worlds while being supported by Mario’s hat. There are some parts of the game where a level goes into retro-style, as if it came out of the original Super Mario Bros.. </p>
<p class="h1">The Legend of Zelda</p>
<img src="file:///C|/Users/jacobtidwell/Downloads/197c2f18042767.562c2d6f25b42.jpg" width="300" height="213" alt=""/>
<p class="h1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="h1">-The Legend of Zelda was introduced in 1986, when the first game, simply titled The Legend of Zelda, was released for the NES. The game has a 2D, overhead setting and was an early open-world game. The goal of the game is simple: to rescue a princess from an evil captor, in this case Ganon, as well as save the Kingdom of Hyrule. Ganon has cast a spell on his lair that can only be removed using the Triforce. </p>
<p class="h1">-A sequel of the game was released in 1987, called Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. Unlike the original game, this game features a side-scrolling perspective and has some RPG elements including a level-up system. </p>
<p class="h1">-The third major game in the series was The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, released in 1991, making the series’ debut on the SNES. The story acts as a prequel to the two games that preceded it, and it revived the original overhead setting. </p>
<p class="h1">-In the fourth installment of the game, The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, Link has been shipwrecked on an island far from Hyrule and now has to battle a new enemy in order to leave. It was released for the GameBoy in 1993. </p>
<p class="h1">-Also in 1993 were the release of the infamous Zelda CD-i game The Legend of Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon which, just like Hotel Mario on the same platform, was a huge flop. </p>
<p class="h1">-Five years later in 1998, the first 3D Zelda game was released, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It was made for the Nintendo 64. With the new 3D design, new features were added, such as Link’s horse as well as “Z-targeting.” </p>
<p class="h1">-Link has been a major character in the Super Smash Bros. series. </p>
<p class="h1">-The next title released was The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask, which is a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time, released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64. The game has the same visual style, but the Kingdom of Hyrule has been replaced by a land called Termina, which is supposed to be destroyed in three days when the moon crashes into it. Link has to relive those three days over and over again. </p>
<p class="h1">-After Majora’s Mask came The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons/Oracle of Ages, which was released in 2001 for the GameBoy Color. This one is interesting as it is actually two separate games set in two different locations. When a player completes one of the games, they are given a password to which they can access the other as a sequel. </p>
<p class="h1">-The next major title was The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, released in 2002 for the GameCube. Much of the game is spent sailing between islands due to the Kingdom of Hyrule being buried beneath the ocean.Despite having cartoonish graphics, it is considered one of the best entries in the series. </p>
<p class="h1">-The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures followed, released in 2004 also for the GameCube. The game involves Link trying to restore peace in the Kingdom of Hyrule after an evil copy of himself has been made. The game is able to have four players.</p>
<p class="h1">-The next title, The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is unusual because it doesn’t offer an open-world experience like most Zelda games. It was released in 2004 for the GameBoy Advance and features Link possessing a talking hat who is able to shrink him in size. </p>
<p class="h1">-The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess revived the usual open-world setting of Zelda games. In the game, Link is able to turn into a wolf and is guided by a mysterious creature named Midna throughout his adventure. Released in 2006 for the Wii, it is considered to be one of the greatest video games ever made, despite its poor implementation of motion controls. </p>
<p class="h1">-The next Zelda title, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is similar to The Wind Waker and actually acts as a direct sequel to it. It was released in 2007 for the Nintendo DS and is about Link going to save his friend Tetra with help from Captain Lineback and his ship. </p>
<p class="h1">-Two years later in 2009, The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks was released for the DS and eventually the Wii U. It used a modified version of Phantom Hourglass’ background to the story of railroads imprisoning ancient evil starting to disappear. </p>
<p class="h1">-Similar to Twilight Princess, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword was designed to utilize the Wii’s unique controller. It received criticism for its motion control implementation just as Twilight Princess had in 2006. The game was released in 2011 for the Wii and later the Wii U. </p>
<p class="h1"> -Released in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is similar to A Link to the Past from 1991 as it has the same setting except further in the future. The game introduced a new mechanic that involves two-dimensional painting that is capable of sliding along walls. </p>
<p class="h1">-The next title, The Legend of Zelda: Triforce Heroes, released in 2015 for the 3DS, revived the cooperative-focused gameplay of Four Swords Adventures having up to three players that work together to clear dungeons and solve puzzles. </p>
<p class="h1">&nbsp;-The most recent title in the series, released for the Nintendo Switch in 2017, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has sold more copies than the console itself and introduces new mechanics such as weapon durability and cooking.</p>
